# rooms-boilerplate
Just clone and have a template done for logging in / registering with ROOMS!

# Note:
jquery is included twice, idk how to fix that, otherwise js file doesn't work with jquery.

# Change:
in config/keys.js -> games to your database name

in views/layout.ejs -> website title

in package.json -> app name
